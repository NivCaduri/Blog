      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Niv Caduri, a 29-year-old enthusiast in the
        ever-evolving realm of technology. Currently pursuing a degree in
        Computer Science at IDC Herzliya, I'm on an exciting journey of learning
        and discovery in the world of software development.
        <br />
        <br />
        My passion for coding and innovation has led me to embark on this
        adventure of creating a blog application. Here, I aim to blend my
        technical skills with my creative flair to craft a space that's not just
        about sharing thoughts and experiences, but also about fostering
        connections and sparking conversations.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a budding Software Developer, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to
        translate ideas into tangible solutions, and this blog stands as a
        testament to that aspiration. It's more than just lines of code; it's a
        canvas where I experiment, learn, and engage with a community that
        shares my excitement for technology and its endless possibilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Join me on this journey as I explore the dynamic landscape of
        programming, share insights from my studies, and dive into the latest
        trends and developments in the tech world. Together, let's embark on a
        quest to turn bits and bytes into meaningful experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for joining me, and I look forward to connecting with you
        through this platform.
